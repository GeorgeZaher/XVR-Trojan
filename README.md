# XVR-Trojan
- Tested and runs on windows 10, on windows 7 some commands may not work properly
- You can do what you wan't with the code
- I programmed it just for fun

You can start the program with two options..
 - -Time for displaying time
 - -Color for colorful console
 
If you don't like setted colors, the master will generate "xvr_colors.cfg" and you can add there custom colors. NOTE: The color values are the same as in Command Prompt, just in 10 base system... so 0xF0 is white background and white foreground witch in 10 base system is 240. If you wan't tha slave to infect, in the slave folder in main.c uncomment line 14

Compiled with MinGW, for debuging using  "drmemory" link:http://www.drmemory.org
